The outlines of this project:
+ scrape.py: building block instances that can navigate through the page
+ iter.py: navigates through a population on the islan and performs some task(that you implement)

Potential scripts(in the future):
+ A script that navigates through one's island contact list
+ A script that adds all your samples to a contact list 
+ A script that allows randomization of experiments 

This project was built using Selenium and Python3
